# Welcome to LetheanVPN 

The best place to talk with us is via Discord; we have many tasks on various languages/skill sets but don't generally publish what is needed.

We are looking for developers who want to re-grow the project with us and value tokens in return for tasks for shared success in the project, that started in 2017, stopped and given to the community in 2019; in mid 2021 a new project lead was found who has since re-imagined the scope and impimentation of the project.

Our stretch goal is a implementation of IP/TCPv9 & Commerce tools for SMEs, we publish the code as EUPL-1.2 and don't plan to hide functionality behind paywalls.

Lethean is a registered Social Enterprise in the UK, non-anonymous project lead with no shareholders to please or payout; the money the project makes goes back into developing software for public good, the company represents the community and not private interests.
